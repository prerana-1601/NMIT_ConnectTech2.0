# NMIT_ConnectTech2.0
IOT Driven system for transparency and traceability of organic food supply chain

agri-block_1.ino -> the arduino file which contains the interconnection of the hardware with the firebase

iot_blockchain_a.apk -> application that helps display the data across the supply chain on the front end and connects the data to the firebase real time database on the backend


Our solution aims to build a IoT-Enabled Crop Monitoring system for transparency and traceability of the yields in the organic food supply chain

-- Capturing real-time environmental data from organic farm or field

-- Data is uploaded onto the firebase for access of real time data which is reflected on the mobile application

-- This could help the farmers monitor the crop growth and give assurance to the consumers about the quality of the products they consume

-- Easy traceability in case of a damaged batch of crops
